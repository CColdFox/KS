# KS
KS - short for Key Simulation -. Simulate key presses with a custom message that you can choose. Design made possible by Pystyle.
## How to install?
1. Download this repository by pressing on the green `Code` button at the top right corner of the page -> `Download ZIP`
2. Extract it where you want, then open the extracted folder.
3. Run the `install-dependencies.bat` file and wait for it to close automatically, then run `main.py`
4. You're all set!
## Important
After choosing your custom message and confirming, you'll have 5 seconds to go to a textbar, no matter what software it is. If no textbar is choosed in 5 seconds, the text will not be written.

Please make an issue if there is any sort of problem. I made this program in less than one day and the code is not perfect at all.
